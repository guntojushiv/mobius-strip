Möbius Strip Code Write-Up:-
Code Structure:- 

The Python script is organized around a MobiusStrip class to encapsulate the modeling and computation logic for a Möbius strip. The class is designed to be modular and reusable, with the following components:

-> Initialization (__init__): Takes parameters R (radius), w (width), and n (resolution). It sets up a grid of parametric coordinates u and v using NumPy's linspace and meshgrid for efficient array operations.

-> Mesh Generation (_generate_mesh): Computes the 3D coordinates (x, y, z) using the parametric equations provided. The mesh is stored as a tuple of NumPy arrays for plotting and computations.

-> Surface Area Computation (compute_surface_area): Calculates the surface area by numerically integrating the area element derived from the cross product of partial derivatives.

-> Edge Length Computation (compute_edge_length): Approximates the length of the strip's single boundary by integrating the arc length along v = w/2.

-> Visualization (plot): Uses Matplotlib to create a 3D surface plot, saved as mobius_strip.png.

The script uses NumPy for efficient numerical computations and Matplotlib for visualization. The main block demonstrates usage by creating an instance, computing properties, and generating a plot.

Surface Area Approximation:-
The surface area is computed using numerical integration over the parametric domain [0, 2π] for u and [-w/2, w/2] for v. The area element is derived from the cross product of the partial derivatives of the position vector with respect to u and v. Specifically:

-> Compute partial derivatives x_u, y_u, z_u and x_v, y_v, z_v.
-> Calculate the magnitude of the cross product to get the area element: sqrt((y_u*z_v - z_u*y_v)^2 + (z_u*x_v - x_u*z_v)^2 + (x_u*y_v - y_u*x_v)^2).
-> Sum the area elements over the grid and multiply by the step sizes du and dv to approximate the integral.

This approach is standard for parametric surfaces and provides a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Challenges Faced:-
-> Numerical Stability: Computing partial derivatives and their cross products required careful derivation to ensure correctness. Errors in the parametric equations or derivatives could lead to inaccurate area or length calculations.
-> Visualization: Matplotlib's 3D plotting can be sensitive to mesh resolution. A resolution of n=100 was chosen to balance detail and performance, but very low resolutions led to jagged visuals, while high resolutions increased computation time.
-> Edge Length Calculation: The Möbius strip has a single boundary, which required careful handling to compute the arc length along v = w/2 over one full loop of u from 0 to 2π.

Usage:-
To run the script:-
-> Ensure NumPy and Matplotlib are installed (pip install numpy matplotlib).
-> Save the script as mobius_strip.py.
-> Run it using Python: python mobius_strip.py.
-> The script outputs the surface area and edge length to the console and saves a 3D plot as mobius_strip.png.

The code is designed to be extensible, allowing users to modify R, w, or n to explore different Möbius strip configurations.
